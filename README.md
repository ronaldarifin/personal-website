## Welcome! This is the code for my personal website.

#Learning Goals:
- The goal here is to review CSS by utilizing Tailwind. A few concepts I got reminded was margins, paddings, flexbox, grid, viewports, typography theory.

#What's Next?
- I want to add a blogging feature so that I can write personal stories and some techncial writing

#How it is built?
I built my website using templates of Next.JS. Then I realized that it looks too much like a corporate website, so I decided to revamp it into kind of my style.
You can see it here at ronaldarifin.com

#How is it deployed?
I didn't configure too much of the deployments in this one
